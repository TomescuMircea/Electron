# Electron: App for Building and Visualizing Electrical Circuits

Electron is an application designed to build and visualize electrical circuits. It was developed as a team project during the first semester of the first year at university by myself and my colleague **Alexandru Ro»ôca**.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Component Library**: Includes symbols for a wide range of electronic components such as:
  - Ammeter
  - Transistor
  - Capacitor
  - Ground
  - Electrical wires
  - ...and many others.
  
- **Smart Wire Management**:
  - Wires connect multiple components seamlessly.
  - Automatically rearranges wires when components are moved.
  - Utilizes the A* algorithm to ensure the most economical path for wires.

- **Multilingual Support**:
  - Available in **English**, **French**, and **Romanian**.
 
- **Sound Support**:
  - Added sound effects to enhance the user experience and provide better feedback during interactions.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: `graphics.h`

This project was our first hands-on experience with software development, combining creativity and technical knowledge to create a practical application. It reflects our efforts and learning during the early stages of our academic journey.
